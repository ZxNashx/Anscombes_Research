# Anscombes Quartet Research
This program is designed to generate and analyze synthetic data sets that replicate the properties of Anscombe’s quartet. Anscombe’s quartet is a set of four data sets that share nearly identical summary statistics—mean, variance, and linear regression properties—yet have significantly different graphical appearances when plotted. The goal of this project is to recreate these data sets using linear regression techniques, linear algebra, and numerical methods while demonstrating the importance of visual data analysis.
